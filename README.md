# Slightly modded GameShell launcher
This launcher will be kept fairly updated with the original and beside some visual, cosmetic changes and different folder structure, should be retaining all the functionality of the original.
It can also be used side by side with original launchers (launcher and launchergo) and they can all be switched easily with a provided script.

Also, please see the original [README.md](https://github.com/clockworkpi/launcher/blob/master/README.md) by clockworkpi.

# Installation [TODO]

# [TODO] Screenshots to be updated
